# mobile-app-template-package

For this repo, I opted to make a react template, using TypeScript, since there are a few of those. This app also includes dark mode, and as well as Internationalization (I18N) for the content within the applciation. I using React-Native, with expo, I trust that many of you might find it useful, by trimming down on the UI work, and allowing you to focus more on the logic/code.

# [DanWare Software UI React Native]

Start your development with a Design System for React Native inspired by DanWare Software UI KIT. If you like simple UI's KIT, you will love this react native app template! I am sure you will find it useful

### FULLY CODED COMPONENTS

Soft UI React Native features over 100 variations of components like buttons, inputs, cards, navigations etc, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify inside our theme file.

### Components & Cards

Soft UI React Native comes packed with a large number of components and cards. Putting together a mobile app has never been easier than matching together different components. From the profile screen to a settings screen, you can easily customise and build your screens. We have created multiple options for you to put together and customise into pixel perfect screens.

### Example Screens

If you want to get inspiration or just show something directly to your clients, you can jump start your development with our pre-built example screens. From onboarding screens to profile or discover screens, you will be able to quickly set up the basic structure for your React Native mobile project.
